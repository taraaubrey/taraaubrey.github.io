I'm a PhD student at the UNiversity of Canterbury, New Zealand. My current research passion are at the nexus of human-groundwater interfaces using numerical modelling methods to inform groundwater management in developped catchment. My current PhD research is exploring the role of historical conditions of tangata whenua in New Zealand before Europpean settlement. I am working with a small community to understand early-settlement legacy effects on an important cultural spring.
